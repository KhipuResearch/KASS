## Overview

Workforce development programs need rigorous evaluation to justify continued funding and identify what works. This notebook provides a complete framework for estimating program ROI using quasi-experimental methods and administrative data.

---

## Methods

### Impact Estimation
- Propensity score matching on administrative records
- Difference-in-differences with matched comparison groups
- Bounds analysis under selection on unobservables

### Cost-Benefit Framework
- OMB Circular A-4 compliant methodology
- Proper discounting and time horizons
- Sensitivity analysis on key parameters

---

## Outcomes Measured

### Earnings Impacts
- Short-term (1-2 years post-program)
- Medium-term (3-5 years)
- Long-term projections with decay assumptions

### Fiscal Effects
- Tax revenue changes
- Transfer payment reductions
- Program cost accounting

---

## Key Outputs

### Net Present Value (NPV)
- From participant perspective
- From government perspective
- From social perspective

### Benefit-Cost Ratio
- Point estimates with confidence intervals
- Sensitivity to discount rate
- Break-even analysis
