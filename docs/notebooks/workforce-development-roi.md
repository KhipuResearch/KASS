## Overview

Workforce development programs need rigorous evaluation to justify continued funding and identify what works. This notebook provides a complete framework for estimating program ROI using quasi-experimental methods and administrative data, meeting federal standards for regulatory impact analysis.

---

## Methods

### Impact Estimation

- Propensity score matching on administrative records
- Difference-in-differences with matched comparison groups
- Bounds analysis under selection on unobservables

### Cost-Benefit Framework

- OMB Circular A-4 compliant methodology
- Proper discounting and time horizons
- Sensitivity analysis on key parameters

---

## Outcomes Measured

### Earnings Impacts

- Short-term (1-2 years post-program)
- Medium-term (3-5 years)
- Long-term projections with decay assumptions

### Fiscal Effects

- Tax revenue changes
- Transfer payment reductions
- Program cost accounting

### Distributional Analysis

- Effects by demographic group
- Geographic variation
- Baseline skill level heterogeneity

---

## Key Outputs

### Net Present Value (NPV)

- From participant perspective
- From government perspective
- From social perspective

### Benefit-Cost Ratio

- Point estimates with confidence intervals
- Sensitivity to discount rate
- Break-even analysis

### Return on Investment

- Per-participant ROI
- Program-level ROI
- Comparison to alternative investments

## When to Use This

**Good fit:**

- WIOA program evaluation
- State workforce agency reporting
- Grant applications requiring ROI estimates
- Legislative testimony on program effectiveness

**Data requirements:**

- Administrative earnings records (UI wage records)
- Program participation data
- Comparison group identification
