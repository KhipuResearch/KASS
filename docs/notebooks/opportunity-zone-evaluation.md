## Overview

The Opportunity Zone program (established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) provides tax incentives for investment in designated low-income census tracts. This notebook provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating OZ impacts using rigorous causal inference methods.

---

## Methods

### Difference-in-Differences

- Comparing designated vs. eligible-but-not-designated tracts
- Parallel trends validation
- Event study specifications

### Synthetic Control

- Constructing counterfactuals for specific zones
- Placebo testing across non-designated tracts
- Weight interpretation for policy insight

---

## Outcomes Examined

### Housing Markets

- Home prices and rents
- Housing starts and permits
- Displacement indicators

### Business Investment

- Establishment counts
- Employment growth
- Capital investment proxies

### Community Outcomes

- Poverty rates
- Income distribution
- Population composition

---

## Equity Analysis

The notebook includes specific attention to:

- **Displacement risk**: Are original residents benefiting or being displaced?
- **Investment targeting**: Where is capital actually flowing?
- **Distributional effects**: Who gains and who loses?

---

## When to Use This

**Good fit:**

- Place-based program evaluation
- Local government OZ assessment
- Academic research on tax incentives
- Policy advocacy requiring rigorous evidence

**Adaptable to:**

- Other place-based programs (Enterprise Zones, Empowerment Zones)
- State-level economic development incentives
- Historic district designations
