## Overview

The Opportunity Zone program provides tax incentives for investment in designated low-income census tracts. This notebook provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating OZ impacts using rigorous causal inference methods.

---

## Methods

### Difference-in-Differences
- Comparing designated vs. eligible-but-not-designated tracts
- Parallel trends validation
- Event study specifications

### Synthetic Control
- Constructing counterfactuals for specific zones
- Placebo testing across non-designated tracts

---

## Outcomes Examined

### Housing Markets
- Home prices and rents
- Housing starts and permits
- Displacement indicators

### Business Investment
- Establishment counts
- Employment growth

### Community Outcomes
- Poverty rates
- Income distribution

---

## Equity Analysis

The notebook includes specific attention to:

- **Displacement risk**: Are original residents benefiting or being displaced?
- **Investment targeting**: Where is capital actually flowing?
- **Distributional effects**: Who gains and who loses?
