# About KASS

## The KRL Connection

These notebooks are open-source demonstrations of analytical methods that [KRL (Khipu Research Labs)](https://krlabs.dev) implements at scale. The platform handles:

- **Data connectivity**: 68+ authoritative data sources (Census, BLS, CMS, state administrative data) with automated ETL
- **Model library**: 125+ causal inference models with proper documentation and validation
- **Collaborative infrastructure**: Team workspaces, audit trails, access controls suitable for government and research use
- **Reproducibility architecture**: Containerized environments, dependency management, computational reproducibility by default
