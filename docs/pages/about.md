## The KRL Connection

These notebooks are open-source demonstrations of analytical methods that [KRL (Khipu Research Labs)](https://krlabs.dev) implements at scale. The platform handles:

- **Data connectivity**: 68+ authoritative data sources (Census, BLS, CMS, state administrative data) with automated ETL
- **Model library**: 125+ causal inference models with proper documentation and validation
- **Collaborative infrastructure**: Team workspaces, audit trails, access controls suitable for government and research use
- **Reproducibility architecture**: Containerized environments, dependency management, computational reproducibility by default

If you find these notebooks useful but need to run hundreds of analyses rather than one, need institutional-grade infrastructure, or want to eliminate data acquisition overhead, that's what the platform provides.

## Citation

If you use these notebooks in your research or operational work:

```bibtex
@software{kass2025,
  author = {Brandon Deloatch},
  title = {KASS: KHIPU Analytics for Social Science},
  year = {2025},
  publisher = {GitHub},
  url = {https://github.com/KhipuResearch/KASS}
}
```

And if you publish results derived from these methods, cite the original econometric papers referenced in each notebook.
