# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

KASS exists to advance rigorous policy analysis through open collaboration. We are committed to providing a welcoming, professional environment for everyone regardless of experience level, background, or identity.

## Our Standards

**Positive behaviors:**
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Prioritizing methodological rigor and intellectual honesty

**Unacceptable behaviors:**
- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Trolling, inflammatory comments, or sustained disruption
- Promoting methodologically unsound practices
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Methodological Standards

As a community focused on causal inference and policy analysis, we hold ourselves to high standards:

- **Intellectual honesty**: Acknowledge limitations and uncertainty
- **Cite sources**: Give credit for ideas, code, and methods
- **Constructive critique**: Challenge ideas with evidence, not rhetoric
- **Transparent methods**: Share assumptions and identification strategies clearly
- **No p-hacking**: Report results honestly, including null findings

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces (repository, issues, discussions, pull requests) and when representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at **conduct@krlabs.dev**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct, and to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Consequences
