## What This Is

KASS is a curated set of Jupyter notebooks that tackle real policy questions using rigorous causal inference methods. These aren't toy examples—they're the kind of analyses that federal agencies, research institutions, and policy shops actually run.

- **A showcase** of what's possible with modern econometric methods
- **A learning resource** for applied researchers who need to estimate causal effects
- **A technical proof-of-concept** for the [KRL (Khipu Research Labs)](https://krlabs.dev) platform
